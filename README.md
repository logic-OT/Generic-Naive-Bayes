# Generic-Naive-Bayes
This is an implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm that predicts the class label of an input sequence based on its features. The class is initialized with training data, labels, and a smoothing parameter, and it uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the conditional probability of a class given a feature.
